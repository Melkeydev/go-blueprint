- **Pre-established Go Project Structure**: Save time and effort by having the entire Go project structure set up automatically. No need to worry about directory layouts or configuration files.

- **HTTP Server Configuration Made Easy**: Whether you prefer Go's standard library HTTP package, Chi, Gin, Fiber, Gorilla/mux or Echo, Go Blueprint caters to your server setup needs.

- **Focus on Your Application Code**: With Go Blueprint handling the project scaffolding, you can dedicate more time and energy to developing your application logic.

## Project Structure

By visiting the Blueprint UI website at [go-blueprint.dev](https://go.blueprint.dev), you can interact with a visual representation of the project setup before executing commands. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating CLI commands and visualizing project structures.
