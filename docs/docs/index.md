## Why Choose Go Blueprint?

- **Easy Setup and Installation**: Go Blueprint simplifies the setup process, making it a breeze to install and get started with your Go projects.

- **Pre-established Go Project Structure**: Save time and effort by having the entire Go project structure set up automatically. No need to worry about directory layouts or configuration files.

- **HTTP Server Configuration Made Easy**: Whether you prefer Go's standard library HTTP package, Chi, Gin, Fiber, HttpRouter, Gorilla/mux or Echo, Go Blueprint caters to your server setup needs.

- **Focus on Your Application Code**: With Go Blueprint handling the project scaffolding, you can dedicate more time and energy to developing your application logic.

```

- **`cmd/`**: Contains the entry points for your application.

  - **`api/`**: Main file (`main.go`).

  - **`web/`**: Main files for the web part of your application, including JavaScript (`js/`), templates (`base.templ`, `efs.go`, `hello.go`, `hello.templ`).

- **`.github/`**: GitHub Actions workflows for testing and releasing (`go-test.yml`, `release.yml`).

- **`internal/`**: Internal packages or modules of your application.

  - **`database/`**: `database.go` file for handling database-related functionality.

  - **`server/`**: Files related to the server, such as `routes.go` for defining routes and `server.go` for server-related logic.

- **`tests/`**: Test files, with `handler_test.go` as an example.

- **`.air.toml`**: Configuration file for [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air), a live-reload utility for Go.

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Configuration file for Docker Compose, defining DB config.

- **`.env`**: Environment configuration file.

- **`.gitignore`**: Gitignore file specifying which files and directories to ignore.

- **`go.mod` and `go.sum`**: Files used by Go modules to manage dependencies.

- **`.goreleaser.yml`**: Configuration file for [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/), a tool for building and releasing Go binaries.

- **`Makefile`**: A Makefile for defining and running tasks or commands.

- **`README.md`**: The project's README file, containing essential information about the project, how to run it, and any other relevant details.

This structure provides a comprehensive organization of your project, separating source code, tests, configurations and documentation.
