To test the /web endpoint when HTMX and Temp are used, you can simply open it in a web browser. This endpoint serves an HTML page with a form.

Navigate to `http://localhost:PORT/web`

This page contains a form with a single input field and a submit button. Upon submitting the form, "Hello, [input]" will be displayed.
