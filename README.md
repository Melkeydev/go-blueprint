### ðŸš€ Introducing the Ultimate Golang Blueprint Library ðŸš€

Are you tired of starting Golang projects from scratch, struggling with inconsistent structures and code conventions? Go Blueprint is a CLI tool that allows users to spin up a Go project with the corresponding structure seamlessly. It also gives the option to integrate with one of the more popular Go frameworks!

### Why Would I use this?

- Easy to set up and install
- Have the entire Go structure already established
- Setting up a Go HTTP server (or Fasthttp with Fiber)
- Integrate with a popular frameworks
- Focus on the actual code of your application

### Install

```
go install github.com/melkeydev/go-blueprint@latest
```

This installs a go binary that will automatically bind to your $GOPATH

Then in a new terminal run:

```
go-blueprint create
```
