### ðŸš€ Introducing the Ultimate Golang Blueprint Library ðŸš€

Go Blueprint is a CLI tool that allows users to spin up a Go project with the corresponding structure seamlessly. It also
gives the option to integrate with one of the more popular Go frameworks (and the list is growing with new features)!

### Why Would I use this?

- Easy to set up and install
- Have the entire Go structure already established
- Setting up a Go HTTP server (or Fasthttp with Fiber)
- Integrate with a popular frameworks
- Focus on the actual code of your application

### Install

```
go install github.com/melkeydev/go-blueprint@latest
```

This installs a go binary that will automatically bind to your $GOPATH

Then in a new terminal run:

```
go-blueprint create
```

You can also use the provided flags to set up a project without interacting with the UI.

```
go-blueprint create --name my-project --framework gin --path .
```

See `go-blueprint create -h` for all the options and shorthands.

### Frameworks Supported

- [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber)
- [HttpRouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter)
- [Gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
- [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo)

### Paths
- use '.' for current directory
- use relative path to current directory e.g. './test-folder'
- paths without `/`, `\` or `.` prefix will be treated as relative to current directory 
- use absolute paths e.g. `/users/{username}/dev`
- `~` is expanded to `$HOME` env variable so `~/dev` and `/Users/{username}/dev` are equivalent if `$HOME` is set to `/Users/{username}`
