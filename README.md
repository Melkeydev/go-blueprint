### ðŸš€ Introducing the Ultimate Golang Blueprint Library ðŸš€

Go Blueprint is a CLI tool that allows users to spin up a Go project with the corresponding structure seamlessly. It also
gives the option to integrate with one of the more popular Go frameworks (and the list is growing with new features)!

### Why Would I use this?

- Easy to set up and install
- Have the entire Go structure already established
- Setting up a Go HTTP server (or Fasthttp with Fiber)
- Integrate with a popular frameworks
- Focus on the actual code of your application

### Install

- **Brew install :**

```sh
brew install go-blueprint
```

- **Go install :**

```sh
go install github.com/melkeydev/go-blueprint@latest
```

This installs a go binary that will automatically bind to your $GOPATH

Then in a new terminal run:

```
go-blueprint create
```

You can also use the provided flags to set up a project without interacting with the UI.

```
go-blueprint create --name my-project --framework gin
```

See `go-blueprint create -h` for all the options and shorthands.
